My code creates a directory/mapping for each sender's port that has started a handshake
I used this mapping to help store a lot of information like SEQ & ACK number, RTT, congestion window size, etc., and for temporary values for estimation purposes.

When reading the packet with the flags SYN ACK, my program used its timestamp and subtracted with the timestamp of its respective SYN 
to estimate the RTT of each respective sender's port to the receiver's port

I estimated the throughput by adding up all the bytes sent from the first packet sent to its last packet sent by the senders' respective ports.
I also kept track of the time at which it sent its first packet and kept updating the end time till it reached its last packet.
Used the total bytes sent over the period it was sending these bytes to get my throughput

I estimated the congestion window size by counting the number of the packet sent by the sender within each sender's respective port's RTT.

I measured the retransmission by taking the latest ACK number from the receiver and the first time the same number on its SEQ was sent by the sender.
Then kept track of how many times the same ACK number was repeated by the receiver till a new ACK number was sent by the receivers to the respective senders' port.
When my program read a packet that was sent by the sender with the same SEQ number to the ACK number that was currently being kept track of, 
	It first measured the current time to the time the sender first sent this same SEQ number stored in its respective mapping. 
	If it was greater than twice its respective RTT then retransmission due to time out was incremented
	else if the same ACK number was repeated more than twice then it is considered triple ACK.
