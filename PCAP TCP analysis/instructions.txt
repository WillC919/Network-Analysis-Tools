Libraries Needed:
dpkt

Open the command prompt or other equivalent terminal here
Run the command:

	python analysis_pcap_tcp.py

It should tell you to "Enter filename: "
You should enter the name of the pcap file with .pcap after it
to get program results

Example:

	C:\...\lee-william-assignment2> python analysis_pcap_tcp.py
	Enter filename: assignment2.pcap

	>> program results get displayed

The pcap file must be inside the folder where the python file is else you'll have to type in the necessary path that leads that python file to the pcap file in the "Enter filename:" input
